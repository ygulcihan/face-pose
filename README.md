Although most operating systems are supported, software is originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 running 32-bit RPi OS version "buster".

Control commands are sent to an Arduino using a USB COM port after estimating the user's head position.

Facial Recognition is integrated with the software using face-recognition module.

A user interface is created using OpenCV's highgui functions.
