An application created for controlling an electric wheelchair using head movements and facial gestures using MediaPipe and OpenCV in the scope of my MECE408 Graduation Project.

Although most operating systems are supported, software is originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 running 32-bit RPi OS version "buster".

Control commands are sent to an Arduino using a USB COM port after estimating the user's head position.

Facial Recognition is integrated with the software using face-recognition module.

A user interface is created using OpenCV's highgui functions.
